# AnaRobot
 
Product combining a robot plus a mobile application deployed on a smart phone that will guide the robot.

# Description :

The solution was to turn a simple phone into a robot. The phone can move to its owner and find objects for him, which will reduce the cost of a robot since we use the phone as a robot brain.
 This is a mobile application that offers face detection, object search, connection between the robot and the mobile ... .to allow the robot to move to the person and deliver his / her medications.
 The app works in two modes:
o Manual mode: At limited distance, mode allows you to control the robot via a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection through a programmed joystick. This control is interactive in the sense that the user receives images from the robot's camera in real time.
o Automatic mode: The robot automatically triggers itself over time to search for its owner and deliver his medication.
 The app also treats people with color blindness, helping them to detect colors they do not see.

# Note :
 You can see the project by downloading the project as a Zip and see the video in it.
 
 We plan to add a project website and deploy it on Azure.
 The technologies used are: Java (Eclipse), C ++ (Visual Studio) for the Android-Arduino link, Arduino compiler, Photoshop, Axure.
 The long-term challenge is to sophisticated the robot and make it a robot that offers a lot of services and expand the number of categories targeted
